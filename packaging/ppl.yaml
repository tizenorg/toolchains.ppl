Description: |
    The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a library for the manipulation of
    (not necessarily closed) convex polyhedra and other numerical
    abstractions.  The applications of convex polyhedra include program
    analysis, optimized compilation, integer and combinatorial
    optimization and statistical data-editing.  The Parma Polyhedra
    Library comes with several user friendly interfaces, is fully dynamic
    (available virtual memory is the only limitation to the dimension of
    anything), written in accordance to all the applicable standards,
    exception-safe, rather efficient, thoroughly documented, and free
    software.  This package provides all what is necessary to run
    applications using the PPL through its C and C++ interfaces.

      Summary: "The Parma Watchdog Library: a C++ library for watchdog timers"
      Group: Development/Libraries
      Description: |
          The Parma Watchdog Library (PWL) provides support for multiple,
          concurrent watchdog timers on systems providing setitimer(2).  This
          package provides all what is necessary to run applications using the
          PWL.  The PWL is currently distributed with the Parma Polyhedra
          Library, but is totally independent from it.
